# SIC-DINo-SDGs-app
This is the web application of our project within Samsung Innovation Campus.

The project's main focus is to build ML and DL models to classify OSDG Community Dataset.<br>
For the dataset: https://zenodo.org/record/6393942#.YstnkxzP3Jw

This web application is designed to predict the related Sustainable Development Goal of a text input.
The text input is a paragraph of text. Our highly accurate ML/DL models will predict the SDG related to the your input.<br>

For all goals: https://sdgs.un.org/


### version 1.0:
Predictor model: [*bert-base-uncased*](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased). fine-tuned with OSDG-CD.
